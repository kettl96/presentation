Hello, my name Alexander. I want to tell you about one the popular js framework.

In nowadays we have huge choice of JS-frameworks. Most popular is react, angular, vue and other.
To create an application we can choose any, but... 
i want to tell you why React is so popular

<b>BUT FIRST WHAT IS REACT JS</b>

React is a popular open-source JavaScript library used to create robust and dynamic user interfaces for web applications. Created by Facebook, React excels in these three areas:
-Being declarative and making it ‘painless’ to develop interactive User Interfaces (UIs)
-Being Component-Based: React Builds encapsulate components that manage their own states then composes them to make intricate UIs; delivering top rendering performance.
-Being unobtrusive so you can write new features in React without reformulating existing code.
Despite existing for only nine years, React has become the big hitter in front-end development and shows no signs of slowing down.

AND FIRST REASON IS...
<b>REACT IS EASY TO GRASP</b>

If rule No.1 in software development is simplicity and avoiding complexity at all cost, then React JS takes the biscuit.

One of the top benefits of React is how easy it is to grasp, particularly if you already are a pro at JavaScript. You can install React and be up and running in a few hours, getting straight to work building web applications. The documentation is clear and there is lots of it. Furthermore, the short learning curve means you can waste less time learning and more time doing. It is almost certainly why React has had such widespread adoption.

Furthermore, it makes onboarding internal teams, clients and new projects much easier for development teams by getting everyone on the same page quickly and easily.


<b>React Builds Robust & Intuitive User Interfaces</b>

React is Declarative

React JS makes front end development is a piece of cake for developers. It allows developers to declaratively describe user interfaces, taking a lot of the heavy lifting out of the coding process while making the code more simple to read and understand. React makes interactive UIs by changing the state of the component and updating the DOM virtually. Cutting out the actual DOM makes creating UIs a more intuitive and less complex process.

That also Robust & Dynamic

You can rely on the React library to get the job done. It is dynamic in its ability to create an interface that doesn’t compromise the speed or robustness of the application. You can be confident in what you create and not have to spend lots of time optimising the code or debugging issues with the underlying library. However, because of the declarative nature of React, any debugging is much much simpler to carry out.

NEXT REASON IS THAT REACT OFFERS A WELL-SUPPORTED LIBRARY

Building robust and intuitive libraries is made possible by the extensive and well-supported React component library and NPM packages. There are so many pre-build component libraries to chose from, meaning you can pull in a lot of what you need to start building better UIs. The component libraries can speed up development times for those that don’t have time to create their components from scratch.

<b>React Increase Productivity</b>

As we’ve already seen in this article, React does a lot to simplify and speed up processes. React is great at streamlining workflows, but there is one feature that most developers rejoice at, and that is reusable components.

Reusable Components

A stand-out benefit of React is its ability to re-use code throughout an application. It’s the React ‘get out of jail free card’ as you escape being a prisoner to hours of tedious and repetitive coding tasks.

React helps you work smarter, not harder, by allowing you to re-use components you’ve already written across the same application and on totally different builds with similar functionality. Reusable components also help to maintain a consistent code style and the overall maintainability of the application.

There React goes again, speeding up development times and increasing productivity!

<b>Virtual DOM for Faster Rendering</b>

React is fast. One of the hallmarks of a good web application is a superior page experience; a massive contributor to page speed is load time. React renders the DOM virtually first as a copy of the actual DOM. React will only make the changes necessary changes to the UIs through the virtual DOM. Consequently, an application doesn’t have to re-render the entire User Interface and speeds up loading times.

As well as improving the overall page experience and load times for users, this has a massive impact on Search Engine Optimisation. By keeping rendering times down, search engine crawlers will favour webpages built in React because of their speed and agility.

<b>React Makes Testing Easy</b>

React is much easier to test than alternative libraries. Even before sending code to a QA team, developers have lots of testing capabilities right at their fingertips. React allows you to run automated unit tests and integration tests which help you to test individual snippets of code to ensure everything is working as you expect.

<b>React is Easy to Scale</b>

React as a library is a dream for scalability for several reasons. First, React apps happily scale to hundreds or even thousands of components, without breaking a sweat. React doesn’t create any unnecessary barriers for developers to build complex applications.

Second, React makes no secret about how they ‘don’t make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack’. React is built to be extremely versatile to easily integrate with other third-party libraries and frameworks in your tech stack. 

Finally, React Native works seamlessly with React to create cross-platform applications to develop multiple touch points between users and products.

<b>Strong Community Support</b>

React JS is brought to life by its community. Since becoming open-source in 2015, a large contributor to React’s success comes from how its community of developers interacts with the library. As well as having large community repositories on GitHub and a buzzing forum on Stack Overflow, developers love working with React. It’s easy to see why.

One of the best parts of having such an active community is that everyone is solving problems together. The chances are that if you have a problem, it has already been resolved by another person on a Stack Overflow forum. Often, all it takes is a quick copy and paste to make your problems have fizzled away. The community that surrounds React is a massive proponent of React’s overall efficiency.


The simple fact is that React is a safe bet for most front end developers. And there you can see tech giants user React

And in the end thanks for your attention
